Hai everyone! :D

This is basically the data for my card game DarKards. It's pretty much just a card game like Magic, but with characters from all around the internet (with some of my creation).
Since this is just a repo, I won't be publishing the rules anytime soon-

Please do not redistribute or use them for your own (especially because it's gonna be a copyright nightmare), although you are allowed to use these cards to play with your friends (if you somehow magically learnt the rules)

Yeah, that's about it.
